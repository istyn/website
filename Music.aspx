    <p>
        I'm fortunate to have grown up in a public school system that emphasized the fine arts. Yancey County Schools was
        unique for the area because they offered classical training on stringed instruments. I played the cello in a small ensemble from 
        sixth to twelfth grade. This video is my rendition of one of the most famous solo cello pieces ever written, on guitar:

    <h2>Bach's Prelude to Cello Suite No. 1 in G Major</h2>

    <h2>Not your Grandfather's bluegrass</h2>
    <p>Western North Carolina and Eastern Tennessee are well known for its traditional country and bluegrass. Although the 
        school system didn't offer guitar (I'm self taught), Dr. Timothy Babb, the Mountain Heritage High School music
        director, offered our class a unique proposal. Mandolin player Mitchell Cannon had been taking private lessons to 
        join the orchestra program with the intention of recruiting a bluegrass band. Dr. Babb offered the class a unique 
        opportunity: join this band and he will provide practice time during class. Little did we know that he was offering 
        so much more. What started out as a small, instrumental school project bloomed into a local band with the backing of the school.
         With elements of bluegrass, country, and even rock, 3 Wheel Drive certainly had a unique sound representative of
         each player's background.
