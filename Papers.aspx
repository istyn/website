        <p style="margin-left:12px;">Abstract: <i>Game based learning (GBL) supplements traditional
            business training and competency testing methods by engaging the user with an entertaining and 
            flexible environment. GBL improves critical thinking and
            the retention of information beyond that of a classic
            “Tell-Test” methodology by using experiential and
            iterative learning. Gamification leverages an emotional
            and physiological response. Integration of a serious game
            with business processes has the capability to improve
            competitiveness by narrowing the learning curve
            associated with new jobs, coaching employees through
            business decisions, and sharpening strategic thinking.</i></p>
