        <p style="margin-left:12px;">Abstract: <i>Utilities desire a cost-effective way to disaggregate low-frequency, whole-house data produced from their existing infrastructure. 
            Nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) estimates appliance-specific energy usage from a building’s aggregate energy consumption reading. 
            NILM solutions with high accuracy already exist but require additional hardware in the home.
            In 2008 the United States government provided stimulus funding to deploy smart meters on residential and commercial buildings. 
            Smart meters report the aggregate electric consumption at low-frequencies, typically no more than 1Hz. 
            The simple hardware of current smart meters complicates disaggregation, but studies suggest that the highest consuming appliances can still be detected with reasonable accuracy. 
            Appliance-specific disaggregation is a promising field, however most work revolves around whole-house disaggregation. 
            The wide-spread deployment of smart meters renewed interest in the disaggregation problem because current NILM approaches are not effective at low frequencies.</i></p></li>

        <li><a href="imgs/GBL.pdf"><span class="auto-style2">Strategic Use of Game Based Learning for Improving Employee Decision Making</span></a> - 2016
        <p style="margin-left:12px;">Abstract: <i>Game based learning (GBL) supplements traditional
            business training and competency testing methods by engaging the user with an entertaining and 
            flexible environment. GBL improves critical thinking and
            the retention of information beyond that of a classic
            “Tell-Test” methodology by using experiential and
            iterative learning. Gamification leverages an emotional
            and physiological response. Integration of a serious game
            with business processes has the capability to improve
            competitiveness by narrowing the learning curve
            associated with new jobs, coaching employees through
            business decisions, and sharpening strategic thinking.</i></p>
